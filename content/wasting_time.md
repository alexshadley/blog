The feeling of wasting time makes me anxious. At this point in my life, this anxiety has nothing to do with motivating me to survive -- I seem to show up at work every day, and so far nobody has tried to fire me. And my free time, as the name suggests, has little to do with my bottom line. So why then do I always feel this deep sense of unease when my nose isn't against the grindstone?

## What should be considered 'wasting time'?

This is about more than me wanting to relax -- I think the innate sense of 'wasting time' is fairly decoupled from actual, real wasting time.

In a sense it's an instinct to optimize away percieved idleness, where percieved idleness is **any time** spent not producing **obvious progress** towards some **important goal**. This is problematic for lots of reasons, chiefly those I've bolded in the previous sentence.

* **any time** - you can't be switched on all the time; it's a classic recipie for burnout. Feeling guilty about any time not spent working is a slippery slope to ruinous overwork.
* **obvious progress** - meaningful progress towards a worthwhile goal isn't always visible. That day spent better understanding the module you're about to develop a feature for wasn't wasted, but if you measure by deliverables then it sure looks like it was. And that mediocre blog post you spent the afternoon writing (oh no) may not look like forwards progress towards better writing, but maybe that's not the point. I'm a firm believer that the best way to make a good 'X' is to make 20 'X's; X number 17 might be the only one that's not garbage, but there's no way to skip making all of the bad ones along with.
